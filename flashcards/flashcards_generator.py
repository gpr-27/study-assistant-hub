        Create {num_cards} focused flashcards from this content.
        Difficulty level: {difficulty}

        Rules for creating effective flashcards:
        1. One concept per card - break complex ideas into multiple cards
        2. Front should require active recall, not just recognition
        3. Questions should be specific and clear
        4. Answers should be concise but complete
        5. Avoid true/false or multiple choice formats
        6. For {difficulty} difficulty, choose simpler/harder concepts, but keep cards clear

        Examples of good flashcards:
        - Front: "What is Newton's First Law of Motion?"
          Back: "An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by an external force."
          Topic: "Physics - Motion"

        - Front: "Complete the equation: E = ___"
          Back: "mcÂ²"
          Topic: "Physics - Energy"
